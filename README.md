## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

An E-waste Facility Locator tackles the challenge of responsible e-waste disposal by connecting users with nearby drop-off locations. This user-friendly platform allows people to search for facilities based on their location and provides details like accepted items, hours of operation, and any associated fees. It also educates users on what constitutes e-waste and the importance of proper recycling.
